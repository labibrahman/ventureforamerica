        <h2>Why VFA?</h2>
        <p>I love this question. During college I started two companies. I know what you're probably thinking: "Wow that's awesome!" Yes, while it was cool, I realized through my two failures, that building a company requires discipline, patience, and a relentlessness to persevere through difficulties. I know, that one day I want to start and run a successful business. VFA provides a path towards obtaining that goal by providing me with an opportunity to learn from successful entrepreneurs while growing a business from the ground up. </p>

        <h2>What was the Application process like?</h2>
        <p>At first I was pretty intimidated by the length of the application but then I remembered "No Pressure, No Diamonds," and really starting diving in and feeling excited about what Venture for America had to offer. Throughout the process, especially at selection day, I was really impressed by the caliber of students competing to gain a spot as a VFA Fellow. </p>

        <h2>Tell us about the Company Matchmaking...</h2>
        <p>Fellows are placed on a portal system that provides over 300 opportunities within 150 startups in 12 developing cities across the US. I had a chance to explore companies ranging from startup breweries to security businesses. Without VFA, I wouldn't have been able to be exposed to these amazing prospects. </p>

        <h2>Training Camp Highlights...</h2> 
        <p>Hands down, it was staying up all night with my small group, four days into the training, programming the winning website for the first team challenge.</p>

        <h2>Your Work Experience Thus Far Has Been...</h2>
        <p>I know it sounds rather corny but I really feel that throughout my fellowship I have had a chance to make an impact in my company and my city. I have been on the ground level of development requiring me to wear a variety of different hats while facing the numerous growing pains associated with building a successful business. It's been an amazing journey thus far. </p>

        <h2>Plans Going Forward?</h2>
        <p>Based on the recent growth of Mason - adding four employees in the past three months - I plan to stick with the company through the end of my two year fellowship with VFA and for the foreseeable future. </p>

        <h2>Any recommendations for Prospective Fellow?</h2>
        <p>I want a prospective fellow to know that for me, VFA provides the perfect balance between agency and guidance. I have the ability to learn skills, develop as an entrepreneur, and impact the direction of my company all while growing my network. This is an incredible opportunity and I feel very fortunate to have been selected.
